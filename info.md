Chorecast allows you to manage household chores using NFC tags with a Chorecast Reader.

Chorecast is designed for a streamlined, automated chore management experience.

This integration creates dedicated sensors in Home Assistant that provide information and summaries about chores. You can:

Track chore completion.

View a clear summary of completed and missed chores.

Create automations using the created sensors.
